#  Customer Behavior & Shopping Pattern Analysis  
*A Complete Data Analytics Project using Python, SQL & Power BI*

---
## 📘 Project Summary

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using a structured dataset consisting of purchase and demographic details.  
The goal is to uncover **what type of customers spend more, which products are most purchased, how income affects purchase decisions, and what payment methods customers prefer**.

The analysis involves:

- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- SQL-based summary analysis
- Python EDA visualizations
- Power BI dashboard reporting
- Final business insights & findings

This project converts raw data into meaningful business intelligence.

## 🧽 Data Processing

The following steps were performed to prepare the data:

- Removed duplicate and missing values  
- Standardized numeric values (income, amount, score)  
- Corrected column formats (int/float/category)  
- Handled outliers for better distribution  
- Encoded categorical features for analysis

## Key Analysis Performed

### Using SQL  
- Gender distribution, product preference, payment trends measured  
- High-income vs high-spending customer segment identified  
- Average spend across different age groups summarized  
- Category-wise purchase volume compared  
- Repeat-buyers & shopping frequency measured  

### Using Python EDA & Visualization  
- Income vs spending behavior mapped  
- Purchase amount & product category relationships visualized  
- Age-based buying trend observed using histograms  
- Payment mode and category share shown using pie & bar charts  
- Correlation heatmaps created to understand associations  

### Using Power BI Dashboard  
- Most demanded product category displayed visually  
- Customer spending segment clusters shown clearly  
- Gender-based and payment-mode preference compared  
- Frequency & revenue contribution shown with KPI visuals

##  Dashboard Insights

The dashboard clearly presents:

| Metric | Business Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Best-selling product category | Helps in stock planning and promotions |
| Customer segmentation by income & spend | Identify premium spenders and discount-sensitive groups |
| Payment mode preference | Supports digital transition and wallet offers |
| Age & gender distribution | Helps define audience for marketing |
| Shopping frequency trend | Useful for loyalty & repeat customer strategies |

## 🧠 Final Findings & Conclusions

### 10 Key Outcomes from the Entire Project

1. UPI and Wallet payments are the most used, reflecting digital adoption.
2. Age group **25–40 years** shows the highest shopping activity.
3. Higher-income customers tend to buy **premium priced categories**.
4. Clothing & electronics categories dominate in purchase count.
5. Low-income frequent shoppers respond best to discounts & coupons.
6. High spending score = High LTV (lifetime value) → must retain.
7. Females have slightly higher shopping frequency in fashion categories.
8. Repeat buyers produce a large share of revenue → loyalty program recommended.
9. Income correlates positively with total purchase amount.
10. Segmented marketing works far better than generalized advertising.
